# Sitecore.Support.97258
When you use the `Date` field in `ASP.NET MVC Forms` the `Day` dropdown list may contain incorrect selected value after changing the `Month` dropdown list value.<br/>
After applying this patch the dropdown lists of the `Date` field will not contain empty values in the same way as it works in `non-MVC Forms` which fixes the described behavior.
